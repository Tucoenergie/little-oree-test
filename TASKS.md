# Tasks

## Task 1: Login a user

### Objective:

Develop both frontend and backend logic to allow the following user to login:

- john.doe@tucoenergie.fr
- Azerty01!

### Requirements:

1. Analyse the codebase to understand the application architecture.
2. Implement a JWT authentication allowing the user to access to its products page.
3. Ensure proper error handling and validation.

### Notes:

- The application uses a Postgres Database. It is not necessary to install a postgres client for this excercie. Analyzing the database models in the models folder should be sufficient to write the SQL queries.
- The ENV variables needed to connect to the Database should have been sent by email. If it is not the case, please notify the hiring team.
- We currently use Redux at Tucoenergie for the state management. Feel free to use any other state management solution if you are not familiar with it.
- If you are blocked feel free to bypass the login and jump directly to the task 2.

## Task 2: Display all user's renovation products

### Objective:

After the user logins, fetch all user's renovation products from the database and display them following Figma's design.

### Requirements:

1. Implement a responsive products page following this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/rrg46xh2OSbqI8AU2Leso2/Page-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=EyLCLBOqutboS0tc-1)
2. Use appropriate styling and components to enhance the user experience.
